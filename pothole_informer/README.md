### Project Name: POTHOLE INFORMER

**PROJECT DESCRIPTION:**
Each and every year due to rainy season we get so many potholes at unknown places, this causes lots of accident to occur.
We are making an application where local people can inform about the potholes (by sharing the location) that are dangerous and needed to be fixed.
Application will send these datas to municipal corporation, where corporation can take actions by filling the pothole, or putting a signboard etc.
